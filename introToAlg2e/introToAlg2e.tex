\section{Problems 1-1, page 13}

Let's start with the largest $n$ that we can handle in 1 second (equivalent to 1.000.000 $\mu$s):

\begin{itemize}
 \item $\log_2 n$. It should be
 
\begin{equation}
 10^6=\log_2 n \\
 n=2^{10^6}
\end{equation}

This number is quite large, the only way to calculate it is by using bc. To do this, modify the source of this file by changing this line:

\begin{verbatim}
 \excludecomment{largenumber}
\end{verbatim}

into

\begin{verbatim}
 \includecomment{largenumber}
\end{verbatim}

About 90 pages will be added to show this number in its entirety! This fact is a pratical proof on why complexity of algorithms is important in real life!

\end{itemize}
